# Kalman-Filter-For-1D-Computer-Vision
Kalman filters are one of the best ways to identify the velocity and direction of the object under motion. Here we use Gausians to initialize prior and keep updating based on sensor measurements. Even predict the movement based on the motion sensor data. By this series of update and predict operations we can understand the movement of the agent.
